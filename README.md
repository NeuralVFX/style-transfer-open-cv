This is a simple example of how to run a Neural Net in Open CV with OpenVinoToolkit, I've exported some of the styles from my [Realtime Style Transfer Project](https://github.com/NeuralVFX/real-time-style-transfer)

In order for the EXE to run, run this OpenVino script first: `C:\Program Files (x86)\IntelSWTools\openvino\bin>setupvars.bat`

## Requirements
- Install [OpinVinoToolkit] (https://01.org/openvinotoolkit)
- Requires Intel Graphics Card to run in OPENCL mode
