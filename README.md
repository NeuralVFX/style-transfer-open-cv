This is a simple example of how to run a Neural Net in Open CV, I've exported the "Picasso" style from my [Realtime Style Transfer Project](https://github.com/NeuralVFX/real-time-style-transfer) as ONNX, and used the DNN module to run live inference.

In order for the EXE to run, you will need to copy all dependent Open CV DLLs, Use [Dependency Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com/) to make things easier.
